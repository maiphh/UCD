        <P>At some point during the Void Century, a man named Joy Boy came across an island located at the end of the Grand Line. Here, he left behind a treasure of unimaginable value. Stories of this treasure on the final island piqued the interest of Gol D. Roger, and he took the World Government forbidding exploration of the island as evidence of it being real.
            Only the members of the Roger Pirates that journeyed to the island know what exactly the treasure consists of. Upon arriving on the island and seeing Joy Boy's treasure, the Roger Pirates simply began to laugh. Roger described it as a "tale full of laughs", which gave him the idea to name the final island "Laugh Tale". Sometimes after the Roger Pirates' discovery, the world at large would begin to refer to Roger's treasures as the "One Piece".</P>

    <P>The Infinity Stones were six immensely powerful gem-like objects tied to different aspects of the universe, created by the Big Bang from six singularities
Only beings of immense power can directly wield the Stones, such as Celestials, and the Mad Titan Thanos. Lesser beings would face dire consequences: Johann Schmidt was cursed to Vormir to guard the Soul Stone after touching an active Tesseract, Jane Foster became ill after being exposed to the Aether, Carina exploded when she touched the Power Stone; however, these effects can be reduced if a group is sharing the power among themselves. It is also possible to place an Infinity Stone (or multiple) inside a container to allow the user to wield the Stone's power without suffering the normal repercussions. Examples include the Space Stone inside the Tesseract, the Mind Stone inside the Scepter and later in Vision's forehead, the Power Stone inside the Orb and later the Cosmi-Rod, the Time Stone inside the Eye of Agamotto, the Reality Stone as the Aether, and all of the Infinity Stones housed in the Infinity Gauntlet.

    <P>The Stone Age was a broad prehistoric period during which stone was widely used to make tools with an edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted for roughly 3.4 million years, and ended between 4,000 BCE and 2,000 BCE, with the advent of metalworking. Though some simple metalworking of malleable metals, particularly the use of gold and copper for purposes of ornamentation, was known in the Stone Age, it is the melting and smelting of copper that marks the end of the Stone Age. In Western Asia, this occurred by about 3,000 BCE, when bronze became widespread. The term Bronze Age is used to describe the period that followed the Stone Age, as well as to describe cultures that had developed techniques and technologies for working copper alloys (bronze: originally copper and arsenic, later copper and tin) into tools, supplanting stone in many uses.
